# Second brain
This repository will help me to opensource my knowledge and ideas.

I got idea of it after:
- listening to [Tiago Forte: The React Productivity Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOKxSFB2hOE&t=218s)
- reading parts of [Shawn Swyx Wang: The coding career handbook](https://learninpublic.org/)
- seeing [Marek Suscak's favs](https://github.com/mareksuscak/favs)

Challenge: I want to contribute 20 notes in next 30 days starting today.
