| **Structure and Specialization** | More hierarchical with multiple layers of management. <br>Roles are often highly specialized. <br>Developers may focus on a specific part of the codebase or a particular technology stack. | Less hierarchy than large companies, but more than small startups. <br>A balance between role specialization and wearing multiple hats.                         | Flat organizational structures with few or no layers of management. <br>Developers often wear many hats and have broader responsibilities.                            |
| **Processes and Tools**          | Established processes and standards. <br>Use of sophisticated tools for version control, continuous integration, and project management. <br>More formalized code review and QA processes.  | Processes are established but may be more flexible and open to change. <br>Tools and practices are mature but may not be as cutting-edge as in large companies. | Processes are less formalized and more fluid. <br> Tools and practices may be cutting-edge or chosen for speed and agility.                                           |

| **Stability and Career Growth**  | Greater job stability. <br> Clearer career progression paths, but potentially slower advancement.                                                                                           | Reasonable job stability. <br>Opportunities for career growth, often with the ability to influence company direction.                                           | Job stability can be less certain due to funding and market risks. <br>Career growth can be rapid but less predictable.                                               |

| **Innovation and Flexibility**   | Innovation can be slower due to established products and resistance to change. <br>Less flexibility in adopting new technologies or methodologies.                                          | More open to innovation and trying new things. <br>Greater ability to pivot and adapt to market changes.                                                        | High degree of innovation and experimentation. <br>Very flexible and quick to adopt new technologies and methodologies.                                               |
