# Algorithms intro

*The intro into algorithms, basic terms and some resources*

---
## Motivation

Handling solving of basic problems using algorithms may be handy in ordinary life but also in job interviews

## What is algorithm [^1]

What is algorithm: set of steps to accomplish a task

In computer science it looks like:
- start with input data
- do complex calculations
- stops, when finding an answer

Examples of algorithms:
- audio and video compression algorithms
- route finding algorithms
- rendering algorithms
- optimisation and scheduling algorithms

## What makes good algorithm? [^1]
1. Correctness
   - sometimes finding the best answer takes too long 
   - in those scenarios often the good is good enough
2. Efficiency 
   - we can't measure algorithms on time. They depend heavily for given data input, language and computer performance
   - there are other ways, how to measure algorithms efficiency
